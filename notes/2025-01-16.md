### Session Notes

Date: [2025-01-16]  
Session Objective(s):

-   Implement the Login Usecase

---

1. Key Activities

-   Created AuthenticationRepository and AuthenticationRepositoryImpl classes to the project.
    -   Classes include login and logout functions
-   Created AuthenticationService and ValidationService service classes
    -   AuthenticationService includes pasword hashing and matching functions
    -   ValidationService will include username and password validation functions
    -   Revised the UserTable class to have the password_hash be a BLOB.

---

2. Key Decisions

-   Decided to implement a simple AuthenticationRepository to deal with Authentication in the application
    -   Rationale: This was simpler and less messy to do compared to the alternatives
-   Alternatives to this approach are:
    -   AuthenticationService service class w/ Login and Logout
    -   Login, Logout, etc. Usecases

---

3. Challenges and Resolutions

-   The concept of StreamController is still not clear to me; I am not sure how to use it throughout the application
    -   I know that it notifies the listener in larger functions when the stream is updated.
    -   I don't know how it will be initialized so that the application routes to the login page.
    -   I will be focusing on this in tomorrow's session

---

4. Next Steps

-   My goal is to complete the repository and service classess so that I can then focus on the login and authentication bloc
-   That said, my specific goals are as follows:
    -   Update the User model to accomodate the password_hash BLOB datatype
    -   Update the User DAO to accomodate the password_hash BLOB datatype
    -   Review, Understand, and Document the AuthenticationRepository class
    -   Start on the Authentication and Login BLoC

---

5. Miscellaneous Notes

-   Finish the repositories so that you can finally start working on the BLoC and Views of the application.
